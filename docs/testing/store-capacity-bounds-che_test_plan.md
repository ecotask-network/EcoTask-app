# Verification & Test Suite Specification: Store capacity bounds checking and persistence invariants

## Summary
Test coverage plan and regression harness specification addressing #24 on **EcoTask-app**.

## Invariants & Test Boundaries
1. **Happy Path**: Verifies nominal execution flow with deterministic inputs.
2. **Boundary & Edge Cases**: Validates bounds checking, input sanitization, and state invariants.
3. **Negative Paths**: Confirms unauthorized callers and adverse states revert cleanly without partial mutation.

## Test Execution
- Regression suites are structured to execute hermetically without external network dependencies.
- Fixtures and mocks ensure deterministic execution across all CI runner environments.
